At Gives You Paws, anyone can upload pictures of their cats or dogs. The photos are then put through a two step process. First an automated algorithm tags pictures as either a cat or a dog (Phase I). Next, the photos that have been initially identified are put through another round of review, possibly with some human oversight, before being presented to the users (Phase II).
