They need you to predict which ducks will have defects, but tell you the really don't want to accidentally give out a vacation package when the duck really doesn't have a defect. Which evaluation metric would be appropriate here? Which model would be the best fit for this use case?"

At Gives You Paws, anyone can upload pictures of their cats or dogs. The photos are then put through a two step process. First an automated algorithm tags pictures as either a cat or a dog (Phase I). Next, the photos that have been initially identified are put through another round of review, possibly with some human oversight, before being presented to the users (Phase II). Several models have already been developed with the data, and given this dataset, use pandas to create a baseline model (i.e. a model that just predicts the most common class) and answer the following questions:\n",
