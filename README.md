This notebook contains my work for Codeup's classification module.

- Classification is a task that requires the use of machine learning algorithms that learn how to assign a class label to examples from the problem domain. From a modeling perspective, classification requires a training dataset with many examples of inputs and outputs from which to learn.

## Labeled Data

- Labeled data makes the training process much more efficient and simple. The idea behind labeling data is to teach the AI to recognize patterns according to the task or target. This way, after the training process, the input of new unlabeled data will lead to predictable labels.
